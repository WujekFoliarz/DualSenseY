### THIS VERSION IS UNSUPPORTED ANYMORE
### NEW VERSION â†’ https://github.com/WujekFoliarz/DualSenseY-v2 

## Notes
- Bluetooth connection is recommended only for controller emulation and UDP protocol, use USB if possible.
- Please report bugs
- If your DualSense controller is invisible after unexpected shutdown, launch the application, connect to controller and close the app.

## My mod says DSX is not running!
This can happen because there is no DSX.exe running in the background, to fix this download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WujekFoliarz/DualSenseY/refs/heads/master/DSX/DSX.exe) and place it right next to DualSenseY.exe

I had to separate this file from main release ZIP because windows defender is being pissy about it.
