## My mod says DSX is not running!
This can happen because there is no DSX.exe running in the background, to fix this download [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WujekFoliarz/DualSenseY/refs/heads/master/DSX/DSX.exe) and place it right next to DualSenseY.exe

I had to separate this file from main release ZIP because windows defender is being pissy about it.
